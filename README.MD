![Project Banner](https://example.com/banner.png)

**Bridging Physical Cash with Digital Crypto Assets**

Silverbacks Crypto Cash and King Louis Crypto Index Note are innovative solutions that transform physical bills into digital crypto assets. By minting NFTs that represent real-world value, our platform enables users to redeem a physical bill for crypto—whether that’s a stablecoin (Silverbacks) or a diversified token bundle (King Louis)—all via a simple, secure process.

## Overview

Our project bridges the gap between traditional paper cash and digital crypto assets. With two distinct products:
- **Silverbacks Crypto Cash:** Converts a physical bill into a stablecoin (e.g., $100 RLUSD).
- **King Louis Crypto Index Note:** Bundles multiple tokens (such as WBTC, WETH, WLTC) into a single NFT representing diversified exposure.

A combination of NFC chip technology, QR code scanning, and off‑chain AES‑CTR encryption ensures that the redemption process is both secure and user‑friendly.

---

## Key Features

- **Seamless Onboarding:**  
  Redeem physical bills without the hassle of deposits or token approvals.

- **Dual Product Offerings:**  
  - *Silverbacks Crypto Cash* provides a direct stablecoin conversion.  
  - *King Louis Crypto Index Note* offers a bundled token index product.

- **Secure Redemption Process:**  
  Bills incorporate NFC chips and encrypted QR codes that, when scanned, trigger off‑chain decryption and secure NFT redemption.

- **Decentralized Metadata Storage:**  
  Bill images and metadata are stored on IPFS, ensuring immutability and long-term accessibility.

- **User-Friendly Interface:**  
  Simplified workflows abstract complex blockchain interactions, making the system accessible to non‑crypto natives.

---

## Product Integrations

- **IPFS:**  
  Stores NFT metadata and images for decentralization and immutability.

- **QR Code & NFC Technologies:**  
  Print encrypted decryption keys on bills to securely link the physical and digital realms.

- **CryptoJS:**  
  Provides AES‑CTR encryption/decryption to secure keys embedded in QR codes.

- **Wallet Provider APIs & ethers.js:**  
  Seamlessly connect to web3 wallets (MetaMask, Coinbase, etc.) and interact with smart contracts for NFT minting and redemption.

- **Coingecko API:**  
  Retrieves real‑time token prices (for King Louis) to inform users of current market values.

---

## Architecture & Development

The solution leverages modular smart contracts for NFT minting, vault management, and token redemption, deployed across multiple EVM‑compatible networks. The frontend, built with React and integrated with ethers.js, abstracts blockchain complexities to deliver a smooth user experience. Rapid prototyping trade‑offs (such as manual bill loading and static encryption IVs) have been made with clear plans for future automation and security enhancements.

---

## Usage

1. **Redeem Your Bill:**  
   Scan the NFC chip and QR code on your physical bill using your smartphone.  
2. **Connect Your Wallet:**  
   Use any supported wallet to seamlessly interact with the dApp.  
3. **Receive Digital Assets:**  
   The platform burns the NFT representation of your bill and transfers crypto assets (stablecoin or token bundle) to your wallet.

---

## Roadmap & Future Improvements

- **Automated Bill Generation:**  
  Batch printing and loading to reduce manual processing time.

- **Enhanced Encryption:**  
  Transition to dynamic IVs and robust key management.

- **Expanded Network Support:**  
  Broader configurability and monitoring across multiple chains.

- **Production‑Grade Logging:**  
  Implement comprehensive error tracking and performance monitoring.
